It does not include any content, styles or other kinds of decoration, 
so it's perfect to use this as a starting point for your own project.

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 7.2+, Apache or Nginx.

### With Git

If you are familiar with Git, you can clone Kirby's
Starterkit repository from Github.
